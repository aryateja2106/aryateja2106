### 🛠️ things i've built

**[Local SQL Agent](https://github.com/aryateja2106/local-sql-agent)** — NL-to-SQL tool with local LLMs. i got tired of googling SQL syntax, so i built a tool that just... understands what i want. Streamlit UI, safety guardrails, works with Ollama/LMStudio.

**[Shrimp Seed Detection](https://github.com/aryateja2106/OpenCV-post-larvae-Counter)** — 93-96% accuracy CV system for aquaculture. Led a 3-person team. Real problem from my hometown in India where farmers count shrimp seeds manually.

**[ChatterBox-TTS](https://github.com/aryateja2106/ChatterBox-TTS)** — Production-ready TTS with voice cloning. FastAPI backend + Streamlit frontend. Optimized for Apple Silicon.

**[NVIDIA Dynamo Fork](https://github.com/aryateja2106/Nvidia-dynamo)** — Forked to understand datacenter-scale distributed inference. Disaggregated prefill/decode, KV-aware routing, multi-GPU deployments.

**[Browser-Use BYOK](https://github.com/aryateja2106/Browser-use-BYOK-local)** — Customized browser automation framework for local LLMs. BYOK architecture.
