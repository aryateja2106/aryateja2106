Arya Teja Rudraraju
AI Product Manager & Builder
Marketing taught me user psychology. Analytics taught me data. But I wanted to build the systems, not just use them. AI gave me the tools to do exactly that.
I transitioned deliberately from digital marketing to AI product management. This was not a pivot born of trend-chasing — it was a recognition that the future of product lies at the intersection of deep user understanding and technical capability.

What I Am Building
LeSearch AI — A research platform bridging the gap between complex academic research and practical implementation. AI will reshape every industry, but the knowledge required to drive that change is locked in papers most people cannot access or implement. LeSearch exists to solve that. Less Search, More Action.
